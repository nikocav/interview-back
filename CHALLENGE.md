This serverless app is invoked when an AWS ApiGateway receives a GET /customers request. It uses the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me) to get user data (name, last name).

Challenges:
* The Random User API contains the user's phone number. Change the code to include in the API response also the phone number.
* Identify ways to change the code to improve its quality.

The results will be evaluated during the interview.
